    "These rules are the foundation for circuit analysis, but do depend on several key assumptions that do not hold in for all laboratory situations. In particular, these rules assume a circuit can be modeled as lumped elements that do not interact through electric or magnetic fields. These assumptions may be violated, for example, in high frequency transmission lines where charge density may be oscillating, or where there is significant interaction of electrical or magnetic fields with the surrounding environment. Since these types of interactions can occur in a laboratory setting, one needs to be aware of the limits of basic circuit analysis."
