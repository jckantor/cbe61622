# # Working with Particle
# 
# 

# ## Why Particle?
# 
# Many notebooks in this repository demonstrate the use of devices from [Particle.io](particle.io), a company that produces devices and services for the *Internet of Things* (IoT) industry. 
# 
# The IoT is evolving quickly with many participants, ranging from [Arduino.cc](arduino.cc) founded in 2005 for purpose of bringing to market new devices based on easy-to-use hardware and software, to long-established companies like Intel and Texas Instruments entering new markets, and to companies like [Particle founded in 2012](https://blog.particle.io/spark-is-now-particle/) intending to share in the growth of a new industry.
# 
# There are other devices on the market that would support the educational purposes of these notebooks. The attractive features of Particle for this project include:
# 
# * A complete cloud-based development platform. The development platform is also available as a command line interface that can be integrated with other services including, for example, Google Colaboratory.
# 
# * A range of wireless device communications available including Bluetooth, Wifi, and cellular moden
